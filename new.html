<h1>Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</h1>
<div class="top">
<p class="sub">Kif might! Do a flip! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Ummm…to eBay?</p>
<p class="sub">The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. <strong> Bender, quit destroying the universe!</strong> <em> Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex.</em> Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</p>
</div>
<h2>No! Don't jump!</h2>
<p>Okay, I like a challenge. Why not indeed! Pansy. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
<ol>
<li>That's not soon enough!</li><li>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</li><li>That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.</li>
</ol>

<h3>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</h3>
<p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Belligerent and numerous. How much did you make me? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. I'm a thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't have a brig.</li><li>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</li><li>Say what?</li>
</ul>
<div class="scroll">
<p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. No, she'll probably make me do it. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</p>
<p>Noooooo! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
<p>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
<p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Shinier than yours, meatbag. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?</p>
<p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Soon enough. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! No, she'll probably make me do it. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</p>
<p>I don't want to be rescued. A sexy mistake. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
<p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! You lived before you met me?! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
<p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>
<p>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Do a flip!</p>
<p>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
<p>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p>
